                         We use your personal data to provide you with the information and products that you request or purchase from us (i.e. to complete certain tasks, processes or orders and deliver your products), and to communicate with you regarding those products that you purchase from us and respond to your questions and comments;<br><br>
                         We may also use your personal data to measure how satisfied our customers are and provide customer service (including troubleshooting in connection with purchases);<br><br>We rely on our contractual arrangements with you as the lawful basis on which we collect and process your personal data when you make an order for products. Alternatively, in some cases, we rely on our legitimate interests as a business (for example, to measure customer satisfaction and troubleshoot customer issues). Where we rely on our legitimate interests, we will always make sure that we balance these interests against your rights.<br><br>
                         <h6>For administrative and internal business purposes</h6>

Where we rely on our legitimate interests, we will always make sure that we balance these interests against your rights.
                         </p>
						 <p><h5>5. Who do we share your personal data with?</h5>We will never sell any of your personal data to a third party. However, in order for us to provide our services to you, we share your personal data with our trusted third-party service providers or our group companies, as detailed below. Whenever we share your personal data, we put safeguards in place which require these organisations to keep your data safe and to ensure that they do not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.
                         <h6>Third party service providers</h6>
                         <h6>To fulfil orders for products and services</h6>
                         We work with a number of trusted service providers who carry out services on our behalf, such as freight haulage and local sales and marketing. It is in our legitimate interests as a business to work with these service providers since we may not have the capabilities to provide these services ourselves. In each case, we will ensure that the service provider is only allowed to use your personal data in order to provide the services to us and for no other purpose.<h6>To prevent crime and comply with laws</h6> There may be other scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to share or disclose your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies or public authorities in order to prevent or detect crime or fulfil a legal requirement.
                         <h6>Other professional services</h6>
                         We may need to disclose your personal data to our accountants where we believe that it is required under our contractual and legal obligations to do so.<br><br>
                         We work with a carefully selected third party IT service that will provide secure off-site data back-ups to ensure our business continuity. They will not release any information to other parties.
                         <h6>Group companies</h6>
                         We may share the personal data we collect with other subsidiaries of Hornett Holdings Ltd where those other companies share various operations and business processes with us. We will do this in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, or because it is in our legitimate interests to do so.
                         <h6>Transfer of your personal data outside the EEA</h6>
                         We may need to transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) in the following circumstances:<ul><li>Where you have requested a service which is fulfilled by one of our contracted agents which sit outside of the EEA</li></ul> These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the UK and the EEA and so your personal data may not be subject to the same protections. However, in such cases, we will make sure that any transfer of your personal data to countries outside the EEA is subject to appropriate safeguards as if it were being processed inside the EEA and under the guiding principles set out in this privacy policy.
                         If you would like further information please <a href="./contact.html"> contact us.</a>
